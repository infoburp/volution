0) Setup a random DNA string  (application start)

spawn a number of threads according to available resources

for each thread {
1) Copy the current DNA sequence and mutate it slightly
2) Use the new DNA to render polygons onto a canvas
3) Compare the canvas to the source image
4) If the new painting looks more like the source image than the previous painting did, then overwrite the current DNA with the new DNA
5) repeat from 1
}

functions:

-compute fitness (DNA, original image)
-render DNA to image
-mutate DNA(DNA,mutation type)
