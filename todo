opencl evolved images, features that'd be nice:

Features:
-any features at all
-screensaver mode
-(gif to multiple evolved images)

Algorithmstuff:
-split bigger images in smaller (e.g. 100x100px) subimages and evolve them in forked processes/threads.
(Is this the right way to do this? Why not try lots of times in parallel with random differences? This would avoid gaps between subimages)
-refine color palette (but allow deviations with some kind of acceptance)

Implementation:
-C++
-UI maybe in C# or with QT
-platform agnostic would be nice


int drawshape()
{
	//user draws shape from ui

    //start drawing shape vertex by vertex
    //until max number of vertices reached or user closes polygon by clicking on initial vertex

    //check if drawn shape gives a better fitness

    //if it does update the leaderDNA
}

int dragvertex()
{
	//user drags vertex from ui

    //user stops dragging vertex

    //check if dragged vertex improves fitness

    //if it does update the leaderDNA
}
